Social networking website allowing users to share their travels.

Project created using Symfony 2.8. It is written in PHP and JavaScript+jQuery.
Bootstrap is attached. Installed FOSUserBundle for user handling.
Maps are displayed using GoogleMaps API.

I am still working on improving this website, many more functionalities are about to come!
